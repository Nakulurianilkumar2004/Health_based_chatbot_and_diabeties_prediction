🩺 AI-Powered Healthcare Chatbot & Diabetes Prediction System 🚀
Overview
This project is an AI-powered healthcare assistant that provides medical query responses and diabetes prediction. It combines Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) to assist users with health-related questions and predict diabetes risk based on input parameters.

The chatbot uses pre-trained embeddings and GROQ AI to deliver accurate medical responses, while the diabetes predictor leverages machine learning models for risk assessment.

🔹 Features
✅ Medical Chatbot – Answers health-related queries using NLP & GROQ AI
✅ Diabetes Prediction – Predicts diabetes risk based on user input
✅ Pre-Trained Embeddings – Uses Sentence Transformers for similarity matching
✅ GROQ AI Refinement – Enhances chatbot responses for better accuracy
✅ Flask-Based Web App – Interactive UI for easy access
✅ Fast & Efficient – Provides instant responses and predictions

🔧 Technologies Used
🔹 Flask – Web framework for backend processing
🔹 Sentence Transformers – Embedding-based NLP for chatbot responses
🔹 GROQ API – AI-powered text generation for refined answers
🔹 Scikit-Learn – Machine learning model for diabetes prediction
🔹 Pandas & NumPy – Data processing and numerical computation
🔹 MinMaxScaler – Normalization for model predictions
🔹 HTML, CSS, JavaScript – Frontend UI for chatbot and prediction

🚀 How It Works
🔹 Healthcare Chatbot
1️⃣ User enters a medical query
2️⃣ System finds the top 3 most relevant responses using pre-trained embeddings
3️⃣ GROQ AI refines the best answer
4️⃣ The final response is displayed

🔹 Diabetes Prediction
1️⃣ User inputs medical data (e.g., BMI, age, glucose levels)
2️⃣ Data is normalized using MinMaxScaler
3️⃣ Machine learning model predicts diabetes risk
4️⃣ The result is displayed as “You have Diabetes” or “You don't have Diabetes”

🌟 Future Enhancements
✅ Add more diseases for prediction
✅ Implement voice-based chatbot
✅ Improve UI for a better user experience

This project helps users access healthcare insights easily with AI-driven medical assistance! 🚀🔬
